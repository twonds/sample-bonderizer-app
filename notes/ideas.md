# Notes and Ideas

We will have interfaces in an interface file, a consumer, a producer and a connector that connects consumer to producer. 

The contract will be part of the interface and interface file 

The notion of a contract extends down to the method/procedure level; the contract for each method will normally contain the following pieces of information:[citation needed]

Acceptable and unacceptable input values or types, and their meanings
Return values or types, and their meanings
Error and exception condition values or types that can occur, and their meanings
Side effects
Preconditions
Postconditions
Invariants
(more rarely) Performance guarantees, e.g. for time or space used

When converting we will replace the connector
