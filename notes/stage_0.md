# Why?

I am trying to solve a problem, but it is very high level problem that contains
multiple layers and problems within those layers.

I want to tell my story of gathering all the platform engineering patterns I have learned and attempt to describe how I solve problems and my approach.

Goal: A software engineer developing a service or platform service can and should focus on what matters. The change that matters is the feature or problem they are solving. How can you compose and isolate all the parts of building software in a distributed system and keep it very simple and very focused?
